# Tutorial: `hello_world`

Per tradition, the first tutorial we're going to write is a simple ["Hello, World!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) program in the KataScript programming language. Here's the full source code:

```ks
print("hello, world")
```

But how do we run it? Well, there's a few different ways to run KataScript code:

  * On your web browser, using the KataScript Web REPL: [repl.kata.guide](https://repl.kata.guide)
  * On your computer, using the KataScript Desktop CLI: [Install Kata CLI](https://kata.guide/install)


## Run using the Web REPL

A [Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop (REPL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) is an interactive way to run code 1 statement at a time, which makes it easy to quickly iterate.
