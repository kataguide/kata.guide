## Why Kata?

With so many programming languages out there, you may be skeptical of the need for another one. 

Kata is the result of my personal frustration with the current state of software development, and a desire to create a better way to code. Just read these and then decide for yourself:

  * Page: [Philosophy of Kata](/philosophy) (mathematical platonism, design rationale)
  * Post: [Kata: Roadmap and Vision](/blog/roadmap-vision) (purpose, goals, and planning)

## About Kata

Currently, Kata is a 1-man mission by me, [Cade Brown &lt;me@cade.site&gt;](mailto:me@cade.site). Feel free to contact me with any comments, concerns, or suggestions!

I'm extremely passionate about building compilers, runtimes, virtual machines, and mathematical libraries. Currently, I'm studying at the [University of Tennessee Knoxvile](https://www.utk.edu/) for a B.S. in Computer Science. I've worked at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/), [ORNL](https://ornl.gov), [Innovative Computing Laboratory](https://icl.utk.edu/), and [other places too](https://cade.site/about). 

This is my personal project, which I've made myself (compiler, runtime, website, artwork). Kata is not affiliated with any company or organization, and I am not paid to work on it. I work on it because I want to make the best programming experience I can, and hopefully fix the problems in modern software development.

You can also check out my personal website: [cade.site](https://cade.site). I post about programming, math, and my other interests there. I also make art! [cade.site/art](https://cade.site/art)
